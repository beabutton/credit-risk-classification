## Overview of the Analysis

  The purpose of this analysis was to avaluate a model based on loan risk for a company. A dataset was provided to be used as historical data related to borrowers loan activity. 

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1
  * Accuracy score: .99 (99% accuracy)
  * Precision score: for healthy loans 1.00, for high risk loans .85
  * Recall score: for healthy loans .99, for high risk loands .91
  * F1-Score: for healthy loans 1.00, for high risk loans .88.


## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
  Log Regression appears to work well in predicting with great accuracy loans in the provided data. 
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )
Technically it is equally as important to predict both the high risk and healthy loans as they together provide a clear picture.
